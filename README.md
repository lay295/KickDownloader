Can download Kick.com VODs / Clips
Not exactly pretty, and relies on an external API I host since Kick has their API behind cloudflare with various TLS fingerprinting / Javascript challenges.

No garuntee that I will maintain the API that this program relies on, and the data returned is very heavily cached (24 hrs as of right now). I don't think VOD/Clip information would change that much so I think that's fine.
